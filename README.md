4. Follow [@TheWeeklyCFP](http://www.twitter.com/theweeklycfp), [@mozTechCFPs](https://twitter.com/mozTechCFPs), [@callbackwomen](http://twitter.com/callbackwomen), and any conferences you're interested in on Twitter.

## How do I get accepted?
1. My thoughts: [Conference Speaker? Here’s 7 Tips for Getting Accepted](https://medium.com/@housecor/conference-speaker-here-s-7-tips-for-getting-accepted-6151af513148#.7tc60xofe)
2. [Tips to increase your acceptance rate](https://www.harihareswara.net/sumana/2016/03/29/0)
3. [What I'm Looking For in a Talk Proposal](http://www.pewpewlaser.com/blogs/655)
4. [What Your Conference Proposal Is Missing](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2014/04/07/what-your-conference-proposal-is-missing/)

## Got accepted? Great! Time to write the talk:
1. [How to prepare and write a tech conference talk](http://wunder.schoenaberselten.com/2016/02/16/how-to-prepare-and-write-a-tech-conference-talk/)
2. [The Talk on Talks by Zach Holman](https://zachholman.com/talk/the-talk-on-talks/)

## How do I stay organized?
1. Use [Evernote](https://evernote.com) or Word to keep a list of all your abstracts.
2. Create a spreadsheet of all conferences you're interested in. Order them by time of year. Note what makes each unique (travel covered, venue, distance, etc). This will help you pick between the many options.
3. Create checklists to make sure you take care of things. Ever since reading [The Checklist Manifesto](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312430000/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0312430000&linkCode=as2&tag=outlier-20&linkId=A5G36554ZQZYVVFT) I utilize multiple checklists: [90 days before speaking](https://www.evernote.com/l/AAiDTMSauUNJaa9Bm7sFzV1Gx8-kPYgSyvo), [1 day before speaking](https://www.evernote.com/l/AAiEvTX0KaFO1J9cwL_CybldCxRNxtuKmp8), [0 days before speaking](https://www.evernote.com/l/AAi862TYcX9AJ6qqbNc9Bx_8vkSuhS3cggg)
4. Each time you speak, log your talk on Lanyrd, and on your personal blog. Tweet a link to more resources. Consider printing a handout that summarizes the key points. The principle at play here is Jeff Atwood's: [Do it in public](http://blog.codinghorror.com/how-to-stop-sucking-and-be-awesome-instead/).

## What books should I read?
Note that some of the books below are available in audiobook format. If you don't have time to read a book, [multi-thread your life](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/career-reboot-for-developer-mind) by listening while driving and excercising.
