# Technical Speaker Starter Kit

Resources for Technical Speakers

## How do I find out about CFPs? (calls for presenters)
1. [Lanyrd](http://www.lanyrd.com)
2. [Speaknet Slack](https://speaknet.herokuapp.com/)
3. Follow [@TheWeeklyCFP](http://www.twitter.com/theweeklycfp), and any conferences you're interested in on Twitter.
4. Follow [@callbackwomen](http://twitter.com/callbackwomen) on Twitter. (they tweet about speaking opportunities, so relevant for everyone).
5. Sign up for [Technically Speaking](http://www.techspeak.email) list.
6. Sign up for [Community Megaphone](http://communitymegaphone.com/) and follow [@CommMegaphone](https://twitter.com/CommMegaphone).
7. Subscribe to the mailing list of each conference you're interested in.
8. When you watch a good conference video on YouTube, Vimeo, etc, note which conference it was and subscribe to their mailing list and follow them on Twitter.
9. Join local [meetups](http://www.meetup.com).   
10. When you attend conferences or meetups, ask people what conferences they attend.  
11. Reach out to thought leaders and ask them which conferences they recommend.

##How do I get accepted?
I compiled my thoughts here: [Conference Speaker? Hereâ€™s 7 Tips for Getting Accepted](https://medium.com/@housecor/conference-speaker-here-s-7-tips-for-getting-accepted-6151af513148#.7tc60xofe)

## How do I stay organized?
1. Use [Evernote](https://evernote.com) or Word to keep a list of all your abstracts.
2. Create a spreadsheet of all conferences you're interested in. Order them by time of year. Note what makes each unique (travel covered, venue, distance, etc). This will help you pick between the many options.
3. Create checklists to make sure you take care of things. Ever since reading [The Checklist Manifesto](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312430000/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0312430000&linkCode=as2&tag=outlier-20&linkId=A5G36554ZQZYVVFT) I utilize multiple checklists: [90 days before speaking](https://www.evernote.com/l/AAiDTMSauUNJaa9Bm7sFzV1Gx8-kPYgSyvo), [1 day before speaking](https://www.evernote.com/l/AAiEvTX0KaFO1J9cwL_CybldCxRNxtuKmp8), [0 days before speaking](https://www.evernote.com/l/AAi862TYcX9AJ6qqbNc9Bx_8vkSuhS3cggg)
4. Each time you speak, log your talk on Lanyrd, and on your personal blog. Tweet a link to more resources. Consider printing a handout that summarizes the key points. The principle at play here is Jeff Atwood's: [Do it in public](http://blog.codinghorror.com/how-to-stop-sucking-and-be-awesome-instead/).

## What books should I read?
Note that some of the books below are available in audiobook format. If you don't have time to read a book, [multi-thread your life](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/career-reboot-for-developer-mind) by listening while driving and excercising.
